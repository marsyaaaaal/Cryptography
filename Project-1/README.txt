This project encrypts a given message using diffie hellman key exchange and XOR encryption..
Make sure you have the latest version of python installed in your computer.

Instruction:
Encrypting..
1 Open first the encrytion.py by double clicking it
2. Type the share g and p for it to generate a diffie hellman key, then it wll randomize a number as a private key for Alice and Bob
3. The secret key will then be generated, and it is used to XOR encryption. Remember it.

Decrypting..
1. Double click the decryption.py
2. Now enter the secret key that was given to you by the encryption.py
3. You can now read the message.
